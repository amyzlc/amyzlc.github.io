Online mis- and disinformation has been rampant throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, driving vaccine 
hesitancy and other harmful health behaviors. In the US, racialized misinformation targeting Black 
and other marginalized communities in particular often draws upon narratives of institutional 
distrust. These narratives are rooted in historical injustices they have faced from health 
authorities and other institutions, most notoriously the Tuskegee syphilis experimentation but also 
in commonplace discriminatory medical practices.
<br/><br/>
I have been collaborating with researchers at Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory University, and 
other community-based partners to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the state of Georgia, where 
the COVID-19 vaccination rate remains among the lowest in the US. These collaborations include the 
<a href="https://www.msm.edu/news-center/coronavirusadvisory/GeorgiaCeal/georgiaceal.php">Georgia CEAL</a> 
coalition and <a href="https://www.projectpeach.org/">Project PEACH</a>. I have been leading a team 
at Georgia Tech's <a href="http://tid.gatech.edu/">T+ID Lab</a> to design and develop a social 
media monitoring and outreach dashboard for our partners to use in their work as community-based 
trusted messengers. The current live dashboard shows COVID-19 related social media content from 
locally and topically relevant accounts (<a href="https://github.com/TID-Lab/covid">Github repo</a>). 
We're also working on a page that organizes fact-checked health communication resources, and a way 
to recommend relevant resources to respond to specific misinformation messages.

As part of this work, I have also been reflecting with our research and community-based 
partners about our experience working on together on these projects&mdash;as part of a large coalition, 
with everyone figuring out what we're doing in the midst of an ever-evolving pandemic. We are 
hoping to write several papers from our reflections on doing community-engaged research and 
technology design.
