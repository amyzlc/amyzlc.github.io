My name is Amy. I'm a PhD student in [Human-Centered Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/phd-human-centered-computing) at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by [Dr. Michael Best](https://mikeb.inta.gatech.edu/). My research considers the design and role of emerging technologies in supporting community-based public health research and practice.

I have been part of a community-engaged research [coalition](https://www.msm.edu/news-center/coronavirusadvisory/GeorgiaCeal/georgiaceal.php) with public health researchers, providers, and community-based organizations in the U.S. state of Georgia, originally brought together to address COVID-19 health disparities in Black and Latinx communities. I have collaborated with these partners to co-design, develop, deploy, and reflect on digital tools to support their communication efforts, including social media monitoring, natural language processing-based analytics, and targeted SMS messaging. I have also been engaged with CHW development and advocacy efforts in the state, including with the [Georgia CHW Network](https://gachw.org/), conducting webinars and discussion groups about the role of technologies including social media and AI in their work and advocacy. Taking a step back, I am also taking an autoethnographic approach to reflecting on the research process and collaboration itself as an institutional site where this work is done.

Before pursuing a PhD, I worked for several years developing and evaluating technologies and interventions in global health and international development at [Everwell Health Solutions](https://www.everwell.org/), [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), and [IDinsight](https://www.idinsight.org/). I've lived and worked in the US, India, Kenya, Zambia, and Uganda. In my spare time, you might find me trying new recipes at home, biking around town, or pruning my cherry tomatoes.
