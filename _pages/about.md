My name is Amy. I am a PhD student in Human-Centered Computing at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by [Dr. Michael Best](https://mikeb.inta.gatech.edu/).

In my current research, I am exploring social media-based and other digital tools to support community-based trusted messengers in countering mis- and disinformation and promote community health.

Before pursuing a PhD, I worked for several years developing and evaluating technologies and interventions in global health and international development at [Everwell Health Solutions](https://www.everwell.org/), Microsoft Research India(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), and IDinsight(https://www.idinsight.org/). I've lived and worked in the US, India, Kenya, Zambia, and Uganda. In my spare time, you might find me trying new recipes at home, biking around town, or reading outside.
