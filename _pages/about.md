My name is Amy. I'm a PhD student in Human-Centered Computing at Georgia Tech, where I am advised by [Dr. Michael Best](https://mikeb.inta.gatech.edu/). I am interested in how digital platforms impact public health and social services, with the goal of informing more equitable and effective community-based public health work.

In my current research, I am exploring social media-based and other digital tools to support community-based trusted messengers in countering misinformation and promoting community health. I have been collaborating with researchers and community partners in the state of Georgia, where we are working as a [coalition](https://www.msm.edu/news-center/coronavirusadvisory/GeorgiaCeal/georgiaceal.php) to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Black and Latinx/Hispanic communities in the state.

Before pursuing a PhD, I worked for several years developing and evaluating technologies and interventions in global health and international development at [Everwell Health Solutions](https://www.everwell.org/), [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), and [IDinsight](https://www.idinsight.org/). I've lived and worked in the US, India, Kenya, Zambia, and Uganda. In my spare time, you might find me trying new recipes at home, biking around town, or pruning my cherry tomatoes.
